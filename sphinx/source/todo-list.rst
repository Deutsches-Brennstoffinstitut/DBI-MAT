TODO's
======

Important Note
--------------

.. note::
   The todo-extention doesnt work quite well yet! Or, not as you'd like to!
   * Todos have to part of the first docstring with the structure:

   ``Todo:``
    ``Some text to describe what to do.``

   * todos after a "#" wont be added aswell.

   * writing a todo in a second docstring wont work either.

   * Which means: the Todos have to be in the first docstring to show up here!

Todo-List
